                <p >"Physics explains how things move, like why objects fall or how light and sound travel. It helps us
                    understand forces, energy, and motion in the world around us."</p>

                <h2>Chemistry</h2>
                <p>"Chemistry explores how different substances combine and change, like mixing ingredients to create
                    bubbles. It helps us understand what everything around us is made of."</p>

                <h2>Biology</h2>
                <p>"Biology is the study of living things, from tiny organisms to plants and animals. It explains how
                    life
                    works, including how bodies grow, heal, and survive."</p>

                <p>Education plays a vital role in shaping the future of children by equipping them with essential
                    knowledge,
                    skills, and values. It helps develop critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving abilities,
                    which are
                    necessary for personal and social growth. Beyond academics, education fosters emotional intelligence
                    and
                    social skills, teaching children how to communicate, collaborate, and respect others. It also opens
                    doors to
                    opportunities, enabling them to pursue their dreams and contribute meaningfully to society.

            <p>Sound is a type of energy that we hear, like music or a bird's chirp.
                It travels as waves through air, water, or other materials, reaching our ears.Sound is made when things
                vibrate, like when you clap your hands or pluck a guitar string.</p>

            <p>Atoms are tiny building blocks that make up everything around us, like toys, water, and even our bodies.
                Each atom has a center called the nucleus, with electrons moving around it.
                Atoms join together to form molecules, creating all kinds of materials and substances.</p>

            <p>Light is a type of energy that helps us see things. It comes from sources like the sun, lamps, and
                flashlights, traveling in straight lines.
                Light is what makes everything visible around us, like the way sunlight brightens the day..</p>
